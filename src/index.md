# Come for the Jamstack, Stay for the Dreamstack

Some say the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org){:target="_blank"} has come to save us all; save us from slow, insecure wads of spaghetti code, doddery tools, outdated practices, and deployment migraines.

It's how the ‚Äúmodern web‚Äù gets built. <mark>It's the FUTURE‚Ñ¢!</mark>

Actually, we agree! Unfortunately what the Jamstack giveth, the Jamstack taketh away. Now we have _new_ wads of spaghetti code, byzantine solutions, and questionable practices often promoted by **much larger** engineering teams than any of us will ever be on. _It's getting nuts out there._

**So we're here to humbly suggest an alternate path.** The Dreamstack, if you will. DREAM stands for <mark markdown="span">**D**elightful **R**uby **E**xpressing **A**PIs & **M**arkup</mark>. Ruby is the greatest programming language ever devised for web development (in our humble opinion). From there we methodically employ time-tested techniques which effectively capitalize on evergreen browser technology. Shall we go on?

**Whitefusion.** Of the web, for the web, since 1997. And now here for you.

## Sins of the ‚ÄúModern‚Äù Web

It wasn‚Äôt your fault. You thought you were making the right call. ‚Äú_Use React! Everybody is now!_‚Äù And so you did. ‚Äú_You should switch to TypeScript!_‚Äù And so you did. ‚Äú_Write all your CSS in JS!_‚Äù And so you did. You loaded up all the latest hotness and spent hours / days / weeks [yak shaving](https://web.archive.org/web/20210111105147/https://americanexpress.io/yak-shaving/) and retooling like a <mark>dutiful web developer</mark> in a heroic attempt to arrive at that mythical promised land where everything is componentized and chunked and isomorphic and strongly-typed and grand.

But you never arrived, because <mark markdown="span">the promised land is a **myth**.</mark>

We call it HDD: _Hype-Driven Development_. An understandable yet avoidable over-reliance on the rapidly-evolving JavaScript ecosystem has brought many a project down on its knees. We‚Äôve seen it firsthand. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not afraid to use what some have called ‚Äúboring‚Äù technology. <mark markdown="span">It‚Äôs hardly boring! **It just works.**</mark> And it‚Äôs going to work as well three years from now as it does today.

Choose the latest stack recommended breathlessly by evangelists on "Hacker News" ‚Ä¶_or actually ship a working product customers love_. <mark>It‚Äôs up to you!</mark>

## Never Bet Against the Web Browser

Over 25+ years of commercial usage of the web, we‚Äôve witnessed time and time again a desire on the part of some developers to ‚Äúhijack‚Äù the browser and make it do things it simply wasn‚Äôt designed to do. From Java applets to Flash plugins to janky SPA (Single-Page Application) broken-back-button monstrosities‚Ä¶**these tendencies come and go in waves.**

Most recently we‚Äôve seen it with techniques that consider the browser merely a ‚Äúbuild target‚Äù of some lofty cross-platform UI toolkit. Have you taken a look at the HTML on Twitter.com lately? It‚Äôs ‚Äúdiv tag soup‚Äù with hundreds of inscrutable class names like `r-18u37iz` and `css-901oao`. That might pan out for a company the scale of Twitter‚Ä¶but for the rest of us, _it‚Äôs a terrible idea_.

Here‚Äôs what we think. **Never bet against the web browser.** Start with the basics, the _holy trinity_ of web development: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**‚Äîall in their proper place and benefiting from a minimalist design philosophy. Avoid undue complexity like the plague. Hesitate to add yet another build tool unless _absolutely necessary_. Use progressive enhancement techniques for users **as well as** developers. Spend your time focusing on what really matters, like accessibility, network performance, privacy, and long-term maintainability.

## Unfucking the ‚ÄúModern‚Äù Web, One Open Source Project at a Time

The progenitor of all modern Jamstack tools is **Jekyll**, promoted by GitHub and written in Ruby. In the early half of the 2010s, Jekyll made static sites seem cool again and spearheaded a wave of tools and infrastructure which has taken the web development world by storm.

But the sad truth is that while the Jamstack has evolved, <mark>Jekyll hasn't</mark>. And for a variety of reasons, it doesn't look like that's going to change any time soon. Meanwhile, large swaths of the industry have gravitated towards tools and methodologies which‚Äîwhile impressive in tech demos‚Äîare often shockingly obtuse and occasionally developer-hostile.

[Introducing Bridgetown.](/tech/) It starts off with the technical foundation that made Jekyll tick, then takes it to a whole new level. It's the Ruby-powered static site generator to fuel the next 10 years of <mark>Dreamstack</mark> innovation. Combined with a prudent use of Rails-based backend technology, it's the path forward we've all been waiting for.

In addition to Bridgetown, we're proud to endorse and support‚Äîand in some cases build‚Äî[a slew of open source tools](/tech/) and [educational destinations](/resources/) all with the aim of _simplifying the modern web_, promoting the delights of Ruby, and providing clear alternatives to the status quo.

## Ready to Join the Movement to Restore Speed, Simplicity, and Elegance to the Web?

If you're tired of codebases which mushroom in complexity until they're unmaintainable over the long term due to _Hype-Driven Development_‚Ä¶if you're weary of practices which make the open web feel like a dizzying swirl of numbers-driven "experiences" and proprietary tech barnacles‚Ä¶if you yearn for the days when a prudent usage of open web standards and "conceptual compression" could enable delightful experiences outpacing much larger rivals‚Ä¶**then join us.**

## Who is Whitefusion?

Where is Whitefusion? _Why is Whitefusion?_ üòú

**Hi, I'm Jared.** I live and work in Portland, Oregon. I'm a web developer.

{: .professional-photograph}
![Photo of Jared](/images/jared-studio-professional.jpg){:width="440"}{:loading="lazy"}

I've been at this a long time. A long, long time. I first got my start building websites in the 90s. I've seen entire subindustries of the web come and go. One day it's J2EE, another day it's Gatsby. There's always somebody promoting bloated, over-engineered technology that's so complicated it requires a  slew of consultants ready to "fix" all the problems that inevitably arise.

**I'm sick of it.** There have been times when I was ready to retire if no sane alternative emerged!

Thankfully, [I'm not the only one decrying the complexity of the modern web](https://web.archive.org/web/20201216033103/https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html). Cooler heads are prevailing, praise be to Berners-Lee.

I'm a champion of the underdog: the solo dev, the small tight-knit team. I'm with the people who believe you can build great things with simple, easy-to-understand tools and a commitment to the greatest invention in the history of mankind: **the open web**. _Join the resistance_ and we will accomplish great things together. I can't wait.

## Save Time _and_ Money! <ui-label style="font-size:0.7em">üòé</ui-label>

_Use a frontend framework_ they said! _Architect the backend as microservices_ they said! _Rewrite in TypeScript_ they said! _Deploy with serverless_ they said! _Switch to Yet-Another-Build-Tool-Du-Jour_ they said!

And now you have a labyrinthine monorepo barely anyone understands that barely ever builds without throwing cryptic errors which is nearly impossible to upgrade without breaking everything. There's got to be an escape hatch‚Äî<mark>and thankfully, there is.</mark>

[Our stance is clear.](/methodology/) You shouldn't need a Ph.D. in quantum-Kubernetes-serverless-microservice-mechanics to deploy a web app. Not everyone is the next Twitter or Netflix, <em>so why the hell would you build like they do?</em>

Well-meaning engineers have adopted best practices and methodologies which benefit large corporations and applied them to small teams, or even a team of one. **And then they wonder why it takes ten times longer to do ANYTHING.** It's like taking the blueprint for how to build a skyscraper and using that as an example for how to build a cottage. <mark>Total conceptual mismatch.</mark>

_Enough is enough!_ It's time to reclaim our sanity and just say no to out-of-control yak shaving and tooling tomfoolery. After all, **simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.**
