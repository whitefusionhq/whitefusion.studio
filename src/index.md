# Come for the Jamstack. Stay for the Fediverse.

Everything you think you know about engagement, commerce, and publishing on the Web is about to change. For the better, we hope? **Almost certainly.**

**Whitefusion** is not your typical boutique Web studio. We're not here just to build _for_ the Web. We're here to **build the Web**.

The _open_ Web.
The _social_ Web.
The _standards-based_ Web.
_Frameworks_ for humane developers on the Web.
_Resources_ to educate the **next generation of creators** embodying the Web.

**Whitefusion.** Exploring the edges of "cyberspace" since 1997. And now here for you.

## A World-Wide Web, If You Can Keep Itâ€¦

35 years ago, a ==once-in-a-lifetime invention== came along which completely changed the world. We already had personal computers, but the digital revolution hadn't exactly taken off yet. We already had the Internet, but _nobody quite knew_ what to do with it. We lacked a ==unifying principle== to wire it all together, to connect the world, and to let _billions of creative souls_ express themselves on a single global platform.

**35 years ago, the World-Wide Web was born.**

And today, the ==next phase of the evolution of the Web== has begunâ€¦but the future is not yet certain. This precious resource is _under attack_ by forces within and without, and we can only prevail if we keep our eyes open, step up, and contribute.

**Whitefusion is here to make the Web just a little bit better.** We're ready to partner with forward-thinking individuals and organizations to build products and services which ==give== to the Web, not just ==take==. Time to bid farewell to [deceptive patterns](https://www.deceptive.design){:target="_blank"}, data brokers, vendor lock-in, and playing in Big Social's sandbox. **Together, we can make a real dent in the "Fediverse"** by constructing a _healthier_, more _responsible_ ecosystem for the ==digital economy==.

## We're the Bridgetown Company (and More Besides)

**Whitefusion** is proud to sponsor the development of [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com), a progressive site generator and fullstack framework powered by **Ruby**, **Roda**, and **esbuild**. In just a few years, Bridgetown has come to beat at the heart of a variety of online properties built by our team and many others, and we're pleased to announce a _massive_ upgrade for v2 is ==just around the corner==.

Besides the Bridgetown ecosystem, we participate in a variety of **community groups** and **open source projects** to push the frontend of the Web forward, encourage the adoption of "vanilla" standards, and promote the rollout of ==open social protocols==.

[**Learn About the Resources**](/resources) we provide to newbies and industry insiders alike.

[**Discover How We Set Up Projects**](/methodology) to avoid tech debt and succeed for the long-term.

[**Explore the Open Source Technologies**](/tech) we build for ourselves, our clients, and the community.

## Stop Publicizing Progress Without Committing to Ethics

There's a different between experience and **expertise**. We don't just bring years of experience to the table. We bring deep knowledge, _curiosity_, and sound judgement to every engagementâ€”==no matter who, what, or when==. We apply **ethical principles** to every decision we make, and we don't just talk the talk. **We walk the walk.**

> **Our pledge to you in 2024 and beyond:** 100% ==AI-free== productions. All the solutions we provide are of the finest ==human-grade quality==. We're not afraid of _progress_! But we're not buying the _bullshit_. Read more about our [AI Ethical Framework](/ai-ethics) we've laid out which presents the minimum threshold required for us to evaluate any "generative AI" toolchain.

Ethics in tech always starts with _transparency_. We're proud of our work ==contributing== to the open source community. **Whitefusion** has worked on projects with thousands of hearts on GitHub, collaborated with **dozens of contributors**, and overseen **numerous releases** as well as implemented successful **crowdfunding campaigns** and online conferences.

We [regularly produce](/resources) technical writing and documentation, podcasts, video tutorials, and engage in ==Fediverse-centric== social media conversationâ€”all with the aim of _simplifying the modern Web_, promoting ethical standards-based practices, and **providing better alternatives** to the industry status quo.

## Ready to Add Our Expertise to Your Product Team?

We regularly work with individuals and organizations who have deep domain expertise in _their_ line of work but require the skills and insights we provide from **years of experience in ours**.

Even on existing software teams, there can be a gap between what was once familiar and broadly accepted, and the ==real-world best practices==, techniques, and patterns which will set projects up for long-term success today. **You could use another pair of eyes.** ðŸ‘€

If you're tired of codebases which mushroom in complexity until they're unmaintainable, if you're weary of _business-as-usual_ which makes the open Web feel like a morass of numbers-driven "engagement" and cloud-service entrapment, if you _yearn for the days_ when a prudent employment of open standards and delightful abstractions could unlock genuine experiences outpacing much larger rivalsâ€¦**then we understand each other.** _Let's chat._ ðŸ¤™

## Who is Whitefusion?

Where is Whitefusion? _Why is Whitefusion?_ ðŸ˜œ

**Hi, I'm Jared.** I live and work in Portland, Oregon. And ==I'm a Web developer==.

{: .professional-photograph}
![A photo of Jared sitting with his hands folded neatly on the table in front of him](/images/jared-studio-professional.jpg){:width="440"}{:loading="lazy"}

I've been at thisâ€¦a long time. ðŸ˜… I first got my start building Web sites in the 1990s. I've seen entire sub-industries of the Web come and go. One day it's J2EE, another day it's Next.js. There's always some outfit promoting flashy yet over-engineered technology that's so complicated it requires a slew of consultants ready to "fix" all the problems that inevitably arise.

**I'm sick of it.** But thankfully, I'm not alone. _Cooler heads_ are prevailing, praise be to Berners-Lee.

I'm a champion of the underdog: the solo dev, the small tight-knit team. I'm with the people who believe you can build great things with simple, easy-to-understand tools and a commitment to the greatest invention in the history of mankind: **the Open Web**. _Join the resistance_, and together we shall accomplish great things. I can't wait. ðŸ™Œ

## Tech Stacks That Last are Harder Than You Think

From ==Java== applets to ==Flash== plugins to janky ==SPA== leviathans to ==chatbots== run amuckâ€¦**these tendencies to build atop hype-fueled platforms come and go in waves.**

Everyone chases after the shiny new thingâ€”without stopping to consider **the impact it will have on real users**. We've had to suffer through frameworks which consider the browser merely a _build target_ of a lofty cross-platform UI toolkit. We've had to suffer through the adoption of scripts which only seem to degrade performance, steal people's data, and ==harm accessibility==.

It's time to ==get back to basics== and honor the citizens of digital spaces by respecting their time _and_ their devices. **Never bet against the Web browser** to provide the majority of building blocks we will need to craft fantastic user experiences. By properly leveraging **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**â€”all in their proper place and benefiting from a minimalist design philosophyâ€”we can add ==valuable business logic== and interactivity while avoiding _undue complexity_ like the plague.

Our motto is **just say no to yet another build tool** unless _absolutely necessary_. Speak clearly and humanely to your audience, and provide genuinely useful content and applications which ==serve felt needs==. And of course, use progressive enhancement techniques for users **as well as** markup-first techniques for developers.

_Enough is enough!_ It's time to reclaim our sanity. If it's true that **simplicity is the ultimate sophistication**, then we're ready to fly.
