# Come for the Jamstack, Stay for the Fediverse

Everything you think you know about engagement, commerce, and publishing on the Web is about to change. For the better, we hope? **Almost certainly.**

**Whitefusion** is not your typical boutique Web studio. We're not here just to build _for_ the Web. We're here to **build the Web**.

The _open_ Web.
The _social_ Web.
The _standards-based_ Web.
_Frameworks_ for developers on Web.
_Resources_ to educate the **next generation of creators** for the Web.

**Whitefusion.** Exploring the edges of "cyberspace" since 1997. And now here for you.

## A World-Wide Web, If You Can Keep It…

35 years ago, a ==once-in-a-lifetime invention== came along which completely changed the world. We already had personal computers, but the digital revolution hadn't exactly taken off yet. We already had the Internet, but _nobody quite knew_ what to do with it. We lacked a ==unifying principle== to wire it all together, to connect the world, and to let _billions of creative souls_ express themselves on a single global platform.

**35 years ago, the World-Wide Web was born.**

And today, the ==next phase of the evolution of the Web== has begun…but the future is not yet certain. This precious resource is _under attack_ by forces within and without, and we can only prevail if we keep our eyes open, step up, and contribute.

**Whitefusion is here to make the Web just a little bit better.** We're ready to partner with forward-thinking individuals and organizations to build products and services which ==give== to the Web, not just ==take==. Time to bid farewell to [deceptive patterns](https://www.deceptive.design){:target="_blank"}, data brokers, vendor lock-in, and playing in Big Social's sandbox. **Together, we can make a real dent in the "Fediverse"** by constructing a _healthier_, more _responsible_ ecosystem for the ==digital economy==.

## Never Bet Against Browser Standards

Oh, there's been many a time we’ve witnessed the desire to “hijack” the browser and make it do things it just wasn’t designed to do. From ==Java== applets to ==Flash== plugins to janky ==SPA== leviathans…**these tendencies come and go in waves.**

You can see it now with techniques which consider the browser merely a “build target” of a lofty cross-platform UI toolkit. _Real talk:_ have you inspected the HTML on a large social network lately? It’s ==“div tag soup”== with hundreds of inscrutable class names like `r-18u37iz` and `css-901oao`. That might pan out for a handful of "web-scale" companies…but for the rest of us, _it’s a terrible idea_.

Here’s what we think. **Never bet against the Web browser.** Start with the basics, the _holy trinity_ of Web development: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—all in their proper place and benefiting from a minimalist design philosophy. Avoid undue complexity like the plague. **Hesitate to add yet another build tool** unless _absolutely necessary_. Use progressive enhancement techniques for users **as well as** developers. _Spend your time focusing on what really matters_, like accessibility, network performance, privacy, and ==long-term maintainability==.

## Stop Publicizing Progress Without Committing to Ethics

There's a different between experience and **expertise**. We don't just bring years of experience to the table. We bring deep knowledge, _curiosity_, and sound judgement to every engagement—==no matter who, what, or when==. We apply **ethical principles** to every decision we make, and we don't just talk the talk. ==**We walk the walk.**==

> **Our pledge to you in 2024 and beyond:** 100% ==AI-free== productions. All the solutions we provide are of the finest ==human-grade quality==. We're not afraid of _progress_! But we're not buying the _bullshit_. Read more about our [AI Ethical Framework](/ai-ethics) we've laid out that presents the minimum threshold required for us to evaluate any "generative AI" toolchain.

Whitefusion is proud to endorse and support—and in some cases build—[a slew of open source tools](/tech/) and [educational destinations](/resources/) all with the aim of _simplifying the modern Web_, promoting ethical standards-based practices, and providing better alternatives to the industry status quo.

## Ready to Join the Movement to Restore Speed, Simplicity, and Elegance to the Web?

If you're tired of codebases which mushroom in complexity until they're unmaintainable over the long term due to _Hype-Driven Development_…if you're weary of practices which make the open Web feel like a morass of numbers-driven "experiences" and subtle cloud-service entrapment…if you yearn for the days when a prudent employment of open Web standards and "conceptual compression" could unlock delightful experiences outpacing much larger rivals…**then join us.**

## Who is Whitefusion?

Where is Whitefusion? _Why is Whitefusion?_ 😜

**Hi, I'm Jared.** I live and work in Portland, Oregon. I'm a Web developer.

{: .professional-photograph}
![A photo of Jared sitting with his hands folded neatly on the table in front of him](/images/jared-studio-professional.jpg){:width="440"}{:loading="lazy"}{:title="Jared in Hat"}

I've been at this a long time. A long, long time. I first got my start building Websites in the 90s. I've seen entire subindustries of the Web come and go. One day it's J2EE, another day it's Gatsby. There's always somebody promoting flashy yet overengineered technology that's so complicated it requires a slew of consultants ready to "fix" all the problems that inevitably arise.

**I'm sick of it.** Some days I've dreamed of retiring early if no sane alternative emerged!

Thankfully, [I'm not the only one decrying the complexity of the modern Web](https://web.archive.org/Web/20201216033103/https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html){:target="_blank"}. Cooler heads are prevailing, praise be to Berners-Lee.

I'm a champion of the underdog: the solo dev, the small tight-knit team. I'm with the people who believe you can build great things with simple, easy-to-understand tools and a commitment to the greatest invention in the history of mankind: **the Open Web**. _Join the resistance_ and together we shall accomplish great things. I can't wait.

## Save Time ==and=={: style="font-weight: inherit"} Money! <ui-label style="font-size:0.7em">😎</ui-label>

[Our stance is clear.](/methodology/) You shouldn't need a Ph.D. in quantum-cloud-serverless-microservice-mechanics to deploy a Web app. Not everyone is the next Netflix or Threads, <em>so why the hell would you build like they do?</em>

Well-meaning engineers have adopted best practices and methodologies which benefit large corporations and applied them to small teams, or even a team of one. **And then they wonder why it takes ten times longer to do ANYTHING.** It's like taking the blueprint for how to build a skyscraper, and then using that as an example for how to build a cottage. ::Total conceptual mismatch.::

_Enough is enough!_ It's time to reclaim our sanity and just say no to out-of-control yak shaving and tooling tomfoolery. After all, **simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.**
