# Come for the Jamstack, Stay for the Dreamstack

Some say the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org){:target="_blank"} has come to save us all. Save us from slow, insecure wads of spaghetti code, doddery tools, and outdated practices. It's how the “modern web” gets built. <mark>It's the FUTURE™!</mark>

Well, to be completely honest, we kind of agree. But unfortunately what the Jamstack giveth, the Jamstack taketh away. Now we have _new_ wads of spaghetti code, increasingly byzantine tools, and questionable practices largely borne out of  the experiences of teams _much_ larger than anything you or I will ever be on. It's getting nuts out there.

**So we're here to humbly suggest an alternate path.** The Dreamstack, if you will. DREAM stands for <mark>Delightful Ruby Expressing APIs & Markup</mark>. Ruby did kick off the Jamstack revolution after all. Maybe it's time for another.

## Sins of the “Modern” Web

**Oops, did you make a mistake?**

"Use React," they said!  
"Rewrite in TypeScript," they said!  
"Break up the monoliths," they said!  
"Serverless all the things," they said!  

And now you wonder why it takes <mark>10 times longer</mark> to accomplish ANYTHING.

It's all just too outrageously complicated, for reasons that increasingly make no sense. We've adopted "best practices" and methodologies that work for companies with thousands of employees and applied them to 10 person teams, or even solo projects. What other industry does this?

You should't need a Ph.D. in quantum serverless / microservice / transpilation / isomorphic / bundler mechanics to <mark>deploy a freaking website</mark>. Not everyone is the next Twitter or Netflix, so why the hell would we build like they do?

**Let's say enough is enough and reclaim our sanity and our dignity.**

<small>(And that's not even touching on the poor UX we make regular folks suffer through like crappy ads, gigantic popups, insecure scripts, bloated asset downloads, and an over-reliance on proprietary distribution channels. Oh what tangled webs we weave!)</small>

## Let's Get Back to Basics

Semantic <mark>HTML</mark>. Modular <mark>CSS</mark>. JavaScript _only_ where necessary.

Emphasize <mark>performance</mark>, <mark>privacy</mark>, and <mark>security</mark>. 

**Effectively utilize the latest browser standards.** <mark>Web components</mark> FTW.

Reclaim the beauty of SSR (server-side rendering) and make it reactive.

Enjoy the fruits of SSG (static site generation) without all the exploding complexity.

Heck, let's even throw good ol' PostgreSQL into the mix.

**Use the right tool for the right job**, starting with a bottom-up (bottoms-up?) minimalist philosophy. _Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication_, as the great DaVinci once said. (Or was it Jobs?)

## Unfucking the “Modern” Web, One Open Source Project at a Time

Back to that Ruby idea…so, the progenitor of all modern Jamstack tools is Jekyll. Originally a tool created nearly a decade ago to deploy websites on GitHub (also built with Ruby)—and still the brains behind GitHub Pages to this day—Jekyll made static sites seem cool again and launched a whole new wave of tools and infrastructure which has taken the web development world by storm.

But the sad truth is that while the Jamstack has evolved, Jekyll hasn't. In most respects, it's no more capable now than it was five years ago. And due to various issues—some technical, some procedural—it doesn't look like that's going to change any time soon. Meanwhile, large swaths of the industry have gravitated towards tools and methodologies which—while impressive in functionality—are often mind-numbingly obtuse for all but the most basic of tech demos.

Introducing Bridgetown. It's a “modern” (for lack of a better word) fork of Jekyll that is quickly becoming the premier Ruby-powered static site generator. ::etc etc::

In addition to Bridgetown, we're proud to endorse and support—and in some cases build—a slew of open source tools and educational destinations all with the aim of _unfucking the modern web_ and providing clear alternatives to the status quo.

## Ready to Join the Movement to Restore Speed, Simplicity, and Elegance to the Web?

If you're tired of codebases which mushroom in complexity until they're unmaintainable over the long term due to HDD (Hype-Driven Development)…if you're weary of practices which make the open web feel like a cesspool of crappy number-driven UX and proprietary tech barnacles…if you yearn for the days when a prudent usage of open web standards and "conceptual compression" on the server-side could enable delightful experiences outpacing much larger rivals…then join us.
