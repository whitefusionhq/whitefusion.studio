A huge focus for Whitefusion in 2021 is providing actionable and sensible educational materials for developers. We're creating the content we wish to see in the world. No matter what your skill level is or what you hope to achieve in your career, we hope we can help you get a leg up with "force multiplier" techniques and approaches to web development.

### RUBY3.dev

[RUBY3.dev](https://www.ruby3.dev) is a blog run by Whitefusion founder Jared White. It's a celebration of the expressiveness, flexibility, and–yes–weirdness of Ruby, with a particular focus on what makes Ruby vibrant and relevant in our present decade.
