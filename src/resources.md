### The Spicy Web

We've launched [a newbie-friendly Discord chat server](https://discord.com/invite/CUuYVH7Qa9) now boasting over 500 members. Join a fabulous community of web developers learning how to use ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù web specs like HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, &amp; Web Components‚Äîplus no-nonsense libraries &amp; tools which promote developer happiness and avoid vendor lock-in. (Hmm, this [sounds familiar](/)‚Ä¶)

It‚Äôs entirely free to get started. Jared is [blogging regularly](https://www.spicyweb.dev/blog) on **THE SPICY WEB**, and we‚Äôll soon be launching paid courses to take you even deeper down the rabbit hole, so stay tuned!
