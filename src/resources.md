In 2022, we launched [a newbie-friendly Discord chat server](https://discord.com/invite/CUuYVH7Qa9) which now boasts over 600 members. Join a fabulous community of web developers learning how to use ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù web specs like HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, &amp; Web Components‚Äîplus no-nonsense libraries &amp; tools which promote developer happiness and avoid vendor lock-in. (Hmm, this [sounds familiar](/)‚Ä¶)

And this year, we have new courses available such as [CSS Nouveau](https://www.spicyweb.dev/css-nouveau) and soon _DIY UI That Scales_ which teach you all the nitty-gritty details you need know to become an expert in standards-based web development.

==Don't miss our sibling publication==, [That HTML Blog](https://thathtml.blog), for up-to-date news on web specs and vanilla-adjacent libraries (be sure to sign up for the email digest!), as well as the [Just a Spec Podcast](https://justaspec.show) hosted by Whitefusion founder **Jared White** & [Ayush Newatia](https://ruby.social/@ayush) of Radioactive Toy.
